# Gesture-Recognition-System

This Gesture Recognition System was one of the first projects I ever created. Using OpenCV and TensorFlow in Python I was able to automate VLC Media player. Possible applications of a Gesture Recognition System are endless. This is a very simple implementation of the Gesture Recognition System. Please have a look and feel free to make your own changes.
